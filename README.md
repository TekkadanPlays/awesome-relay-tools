## What is relay.tools?

[relay.tools](https://relay.tools/) is the fastest and easiest way to launch new relays for Nostr on web-facing virtual servers. 

It can also be built on something as small as an rPi and remain performant. However, the automated install requires 4gb of memory at this time.
